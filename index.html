                Michel Ney was born in the town of Sarrelouis, in the French province of the Three Bishoprics, along the French–German border in 10 January 1769. 
                His hometown at the time of his birth comprised a French enclave in a predominantly German region of Saarland, and Ney grew up bilingual, due to his German roots. 
                He was educated at the Collège des Augustins, became a notary in Saarlouis and then subsequently became an overseer of mines and forges. 
                Life as a civil servant did not suit Ney, and he enlisted in the Colonel-General Hussar Regiment in 1787.
                Ney rapidly rose through the non-commissioned officer ranks.
                Ney was promoted to général de brigade in August 1796, and commanded cavalry on the German fronts.
                Following the capture of Mannheim, Ney was promoted to géneral de division in March 1799.
                On 19 May 1804, Ney received his Marshal's baton, emblematic of his status as a Marshal of the Empire, the Napoleonic era's equivalent of Marshal of France.
                At the start of Napoleonic Wars Ney represent himself as a skillful commander.
                Under his commands French army captured Innsbruck in 1805, occupied Erfurt and successfully besieged Magdeburg in 1806.
                In the 1807 campaign, Ney arrived with reinforcements in time to save Napoleon from defeat at Eylau.
                On 6 June 1808, Ney was created Duke of Elchingen.
                In August 1808, he was sent to Spain in command of VI Corps and won a number of minor actions.
                In 1809, he routed an Anglo-Portuguese force under Sir Robert Wilson at Baños.
                In 1810, Ney joined Marshal Masséna in the invasion of Portugal, where he took Ciudad Rodrigo from the Spanish and Almeida from the British and Portuguese, brusquely defeated a British force on the River Côa, and fought at Bussaco.
                Ney was given command of III Corps of the Grande Armée during the 1812 invasion of Russia.
                At Smolensk, Ney was wounded in the neck but recovered enough to later fight in the central sector at Borodino.
                During the retreat from Moscow, Ney commanded the rearguard.
                For his action Ney was given the nickname "the bravest of the brave" by Napoleon.
                Ney fought at Beresina and helped hold the vital bridge at Kovno (modern-day Kaunas), where legend portrays Ney as the last of the invaders to cross the bridge and exit Russia.
                On 25 March 1813, Ney was given the title of Prince de la Moskowa.
                After series of Napoleon's defeats, at Fontainebleau Ney became the spokesperson for the Marshals' revolt on 4 April 1814, demanding Napoleon's abdication.
                Ney informed Napoleon that the army would not march on Paris; Napoleon responded "the army will obey me!" to which Ney answered, "the army will obey its chiefs".
                When Paris fell and the Bourbons reclaimed the throne, Ney, who had pressured Napoleon to accept his first abdication and exile, was promoted, lauded, and made a peer by the newly enthroned Louis XVIII.
                After Napoleon's return to France, despite Ney’s promise to the King, he joined Napoleon at Auxerre on 18 March 1815.
                On 15 June 1815, Napoleon appointed Ney commander of the left wing of the Army of the North.
                At Waterloo Ney again commanded the left wing of the army.
                Ney ordered a mass cavalry charge against the Anglo-Allied line that failed to break infantry formed in cavalry-proof square formations.
                The action earned Ney criticism, and some argue that it led to Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.
                However during the battle, he had five horses killed under him; and at the end of the day, Ney led one of the last infantry charges, shouting to his men: "Come and see how a marshal of France meets his death!"
                When Napoleon was defeated, dethroned, and exiled for the second time, Ney was arrested on 3 August 1815.
                In order to save Ney's life, his lawyer Dupin declared that Ney was now Prussian and could not be judged by a French court for treason as Ney's hometown of Sarrelouis had been annexed by Prussia according to the Treaty of Paris of 1815.
                Ney ruined his lawyer's effort by interrupting him and stating: "Je suis Français et je resterai Français!" (I am French and I will remain French).
                On 6 December 1815, he was condemned, and on 7 December 1815 he was executed by firing squad in Paris near the Luxembourg Garden.
                He refused to wear a blindfold and was allowed the right to give the order to fire.
                Ney was buried in Paris at Père Lachaise Cemetery.
